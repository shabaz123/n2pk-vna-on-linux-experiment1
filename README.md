n2pk-vna-on-linux-experiment1
=============================

This code is some initial experimentation; an attempt at controlling the attenuator signals on the
N2PK VNA, using Linux. It is not a complete program! It is for software developers interested in seeing 
how to get going to develop software for the VNA in Linux, for the future.

The hardware was a Raspberry Pi.
For more information, see the N2PK-VNA Yahoo mailer list.
